# Gym-RL-Env


The goal of this project is to acquire experience in defining and solving a reinforcement learning (RL) environment, following Gym standards.


The project consists of three parts. 

i. The first part focuses on defining an environment that is based on a Markov decision process (MDP). 

ii. In the second part, I will apply a tabular method SARSA to solve an environment that was previously defined. 

iii. In the third part, I'll apply the Double Q-learning method to solve a grid-world environment.
